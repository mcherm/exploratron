===== UI and Actions ====

I have a design problem that needs to be addressed. What is local, what is server-side. What is sent as an
action. Etc. I need a coherent vision before I can make this logical.

=========================

Messages:

There are two kinds. An InfoText is a message that gets delivered to a specific
player and is displayed until they dismiss it. We show these floating over the
UI. A ConsoleText is a message to be shown in the console. The console texts
can be delivered to a specific player or to "everyone in a room" or to
"everyone in a region".

For console texts:
 * should track order
 * I should probably base it on the location at the time the message is sent
   * That means I need to find all players in a room. Should I make that efficient?
